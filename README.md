On this assignment i will create a recipes web, it should be useful for later use :D
so my goal is to make some of the recipes i already make or at least start with the top 5
that will be Spaghetti, lasagne, pizza, bread and cake

I came with the idea of making the recipes web in a niche market that is the "Cheese lovers"
so the web name and idea will be around that concept if possible

now the html assignment its finished, on the next assignment i have to use css to give a style to everything
a better design!, i already had some front end training but i will try to limit to the things learned here so ill do my best!
